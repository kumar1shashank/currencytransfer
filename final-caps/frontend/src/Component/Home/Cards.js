              <p>
                Any business, no matter what size, will have a large surface
                area for credit card theft and fraud. Here are some of the ways
                it can happen
              </p>
              <ul style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
                <li>
                  Criminals can obtain credit cards by either finding them after
                  they have become lost or stealing them from someone‚Äôs
                  possession.
                </li>

                <li>
                  This type of fraud does not require the criminal to have a
                  physical credit card. Instead, they will obtain basic details,
                  such as the account holder's name, the credit card number, and
                  the expiration date. With this information, they can commit
                  fraudulent activity by mail, via the phone, or online.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Devices known as skimmers can illegally obtain credit card
                  details. These machines capture information from the credit
                  card's magnetic strip, which the criminal can then encode into
                  a counterfeited, faked, or doctored card.
                </li>

                          The only issue this last transfer was that the
